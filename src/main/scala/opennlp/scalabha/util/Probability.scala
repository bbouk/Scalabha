/**
 * This Numeric class represents probabilities using logarithms.  The
 * underlying logarithmic representation is completely hidden from the calling
 * code.
 *
 * This class exists to all for the use of obvious operators (* for
 * multiplication instead of + on logarithms) and to prevent coding mistakes
 * resulting from the inadvertent mixing of logarithmic and non-logarithmic
 * Double representations of probabilities.
 *
 * All to* methods return the (non-logarithmic) probability stored.  The only
 * way to access the actual logarithmic value is by the 'underlying' field.
