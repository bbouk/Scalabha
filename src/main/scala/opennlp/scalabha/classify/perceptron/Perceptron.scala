/**
 * Class for training a perceptron given a set of training instances and

 *
 * 1. We do multiple iterations, and in each iteration we loop through the
 *    training instances.
 * 2. We process the training instances one-by-one, and potentially update
 *    the weight vector each time we process a training instance. (Hence,
 *    the algorithm is "online" or sequential, as opposed to an "off-line"
 *    or batch algorithm that attempts to satisfy some globally optimal
 *    function, e.g. maximize the joint probability of seeing the entire
 *    training set.  An off-line iterative algorithm updates the weight
 *    function once per iteration in a way that attempts to improve the
 *    overall performance of the algorithm on the entire training set.)
 * 3. Each time we see a training instance, we run the prediction algorithm
 *    to see how we would do on that training instance.  In general, if
 *    we produce the right answer, we make no changes to the weights.
 *    However, if we produce the wrong answer, we change the weights in
 *    such a way that we will subsequently do better on the given training
 *    instance, generally by adding to the weight vector a simple scalar
 *    multiple (possibly negative) of the feature vector associated with the
 *    training instance in question.
 * 4. We repeat until no further change (or at least, the total change is
 *    less than some small value), or until we've done a maximum number of
 *    iterations.
