This directory contains R code for generating three clusters from a normal distribution, possibly varying the cluster means and the variances. Two data sets have been generated and placed in the directory, along with a plot of the clusters for each. 

clusters_equal_variance.dat: x and y dimensions have variance of 1.0
clusters_bigger_x_variance.dat: x has variance of 5.0 and y has variance of 1.0

Both data sets have the same cluster means:

  centroid1 = c(-1,-1)
  centroid2 = c(6,4)
  centroid3 = c(-2,8)

By looking at the R code, it should be straightforward to see how to make simple changes to come up with different clusters.
